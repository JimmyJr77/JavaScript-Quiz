<h1>Coding Quiz</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The Coding Quiz is a web application designed to simulate a coding assessment or quiz. It presents users with multiple-choice questions on JavaScript fundamentals and allows them to test their knowledge within a time limit. The app features a clean and responsive user interface, dynamically updated HTML and CSS, and interactive JavaScript functionality.</p>

<p>The motivation behind building this project is to provide users, specifically coding boot camp students, with a tool to practice and gauge their understanding of JavaScript concepts. By taking the timed quiz and comparing their scores with peers, users can assess their progress and identify areas for improvement. The app aims to enhance the learning experience and promote self-assessment in a fun and interactive way.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>To run the Coding Quiz locally, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Clone the repository to your local machine.</li>
    <li>Navigate to the project directory.</li>
    <li>Open the index.html file in a web browser.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Upon opening the Coding Quiz in a web browser, users will see the main page with a "Start" button. Clicking the "Start" button initiates the quiz and starts the timer. Users are then presented with a series of multiple-choice questions, one at a time. Select an answer by clicking on the corresponding option.</p>

<p>If an answer is correct, the app provides immediate feedback and moves on to the next question. If an answer is incorrect, time is subtracted from the clock, reducing the available time for completing the quiz. The quiz continues until all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.</p>

<p>At the end of the quiz, the user is prompted to enter their initials to save their score. The high scores can be viewed on the "Highscores" page, which displays a ranked list of initials and scores.</p>
